## About the Video Course
Bootstrap is a free, open-source collection of tools that help developers create websites or web applications. It provides a faster, easier, and less repetitive solution to designing and building applications. Bootstrap quickly became famous as a front-end framework offering a wide set of tools, ranging from page grids to components that render a web page in the best possible way for any device.

This course is a tutorial packed with examples showing you how to create interesting web applications using Bootstrap and master the front-end framework to its core. We begin with an introduction to the Bootstrap framework and set up an environment to build a simple web page. We then cover the grid system, basic Bootstrap components, HTML elements, and customization components for responsive and mobile-first development. 

By the end of this course, you will be familiar with the basics of developing a plugin for the framework and Bootstrapâ€™s world, which is popular for fast-paced front-end web development
